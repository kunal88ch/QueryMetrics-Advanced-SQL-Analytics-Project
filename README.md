# QueryMetrics: Advanced SQL Analytics Project

## Overview
QueryMetrics is a comprehensive SQL analytics project that models, analyzes, and reports on sales, customer, and product data using a robust MySQL data warehouse. It features advanced SQL techniques—including window functions, CTEs, and dynamic segmentation—to deliver actionable business insights and automated reporting. The project is fully automated for easy setup and reproducibility.

## Features

- **Robust Data Model**: Star schema with fact and dimension tables for scalable analytics.
- **Automated Database Setup**: Scripts to initialize the database and tables.
- **Data Import**: Ready-to-use CSVs for quick population of the database.
- **Modular SQL Scripts**: Each script addresses a specific business question or analysis.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Customer and product reports with dynamic segmentation and KPIs.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers magnitude, ranking, segmentation, time-series, cumulative, and part-to-whole analyses.

## Skills Demonstrated

### SQL Fundamentals
- Database and table creation
- Data exploration and profiling
- Aggregations, grouping, and filtering

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **Window Functions**: RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM() OVER, AVG() OVER, LAG
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Modular, readable queries for complex logic
- **Dynamic Segmentation**: Customer and product segmentation using CASE and business rules
- **KPI Calculation**: Recency, average order value, average monthly spend, and more
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Year-over-year, month-over-month, and cumulative trends
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**: Category contributions to overall sales
- **Reusable Views**: For customer and product reporting

### Data Modeling & Business Intelligence
- Star schema design (fact and dimension tables)
- Business-focused reporting (VIP customers, high-performing products, etc.)
- Automated and reproducible analytics pipeline

## Project Structure

```
csv-files/      # Source data (customers, products, sales)
backup/         # Logical backup of the database
scripts/        # Modular SQL scripts for setup and analysis
```

## How to Use

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

You can automate the entire process of database creation, table setup, and CSV data import using the provided `setup.sh` script.

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
2. Run the script and follow the prompt for your MySQL root password:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

This will:
- Enable local CSV import on your MySQL server
- Create the database and tables
- Import all data from the CSV files into the correct tables

**setup.sh script content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt for MySQL root password securely
read -sp "Enter MySQL root password: " MYSQL_PASS
MYSQL_USER="root"
MYSQL_HOST="localhost"
DB_NAME="Querymetrics"

# Enable error handling
set -e

# 0. Enable local_infile on the MySQL server
mysql -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASS -h $MYSQL_HOST -e "SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;"
echo "local_infile enabled on MySQL server."

# 1. Create database and tables
mysql --local-infile=1 -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASS -h $MYSQL_HOST < scripts/00_init_database.sql

echo "Database and tables created."

# 2. Import CSV files into tables
# Import dim_customers
mysql --local-infile=1 -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASS -h $MYSQL_HOST $DB_NAME -e "
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '$(pwd)/csv-files/dim_customers.csv'
INTO TABLE dim_customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;"
echo "dim_customers imported."

# Import dim_products
mysql --local-infile=1 -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASS -h $MYSQL_HOST $DB_NAME -e "
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '$(pwd)/csv-files/dim_products.csv'
INTO TABLE dim_products
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;"
echo "dim_products imported."

# Import fact_sales
mysql --local-infile=1 -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASS -h $MYSQL_HOST $DB_NAME -e "
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '$(pwd)/csv-files/fact_sales.csv'
INTO TABLE fact_sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;"
echo "fact_sales imported."

echo "All tables populated successfully!"
```

### Manual Setup

1. **Initialize the Database**
   - Run `scripts/00_init_database.sql` to create the schema and tables.

2. **Import Data**
   - Load the CSVs from `csv-files/` into the corresponding tables.

3. **Run Analysis Scripts**
   - Execute scripts in `scripts/` for various analyses and reports.

## Example Analyses

- Top 5 products by revenue
- Customer segmentation (VIP, Regular, New)
- Year-over-year sales trends
- Category-wise sales contribution
- Cumulative and moving average sales

## Sample Outputs

### Top 5 Products by Revenue

```sql
-- Top 5 products generating the highest revenue (from 06_ranking_analysis.sql)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        p.product_name,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(f.sales_amount) DESC) AS rank_products
    FROM fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN dim_products p
        ON p.product_key = f.product_key
    GROUP BY p.product_name
) AS ranked_products
WHERE rank_products <= 5;
```

            ELSE 'New'

        ELSE 'No Change'
    END AS py_change
